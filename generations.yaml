    description: "The DS 7 (initially launched as DS 7 Crossback) is the first dedicated mid-size SUV from DS Automobiles, Citroën's luxury sub-brand that became a standalone marque in 2014. Built on PSA Group's (now Stellantis) EMP2 platform shared with various Peugeot and Citroën models, it features distinctive styling with an elaborate front end incorporating jewel-like LED headlights and a prominent grille with diamond pattern motif. The exterior design emphasizes French luxury with chrome accents, sculpted body panels, and intricate light signatures including rear lights with laser-etched scale patterns. Initially offered with a range of petrol and diesel engines, the lineup expanded to include plug-in hybrid variants badged E-TENSE, offering up to 300 HP and approximately 60 km (37 miles) of electric-only range in later models. The interior showcases DS's approach to luxury with unique design elements including a dashboard-mounted BRM timepiece that rotates into view on startup, watch strap-inspired leather upholstery, and pearl stitching. Technology features include DS Connected Pilot semi-autonomous driving capabilities, DS Night Vision, and an active scan suspension system that uses a camera to detect road imperfections. A significant facelift in 2022 introduced a more streamlined front end design, updated lighting, and enhanced technology including a new 12-inch infotainment screen and updated driver assistance systems. The DS 7 represents the brand's interpretation of French luxury applied to the popular mid-size SUV segment, offering a distinctive alternative to established German and British premium brands."
